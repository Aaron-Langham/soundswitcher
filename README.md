# soundswitcher
Linux script that uses pactl to swap between sound outputs

```soundswitcher``` is for swapping between 2 devices

```soundswitcher-3``` is for rotating through 3 devices

# Requirements
- pactl (PulseAudio)

# Installation
Download the script into your /bin/ directory (or /usr/bin/)

I then use a hotkey to run the command.
